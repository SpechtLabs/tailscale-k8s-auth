### Overview

TKA builds on Tailscaleâ€™s identity and transport to authenticate users and gate access to Kubernetes. Access is granted via short-lived, scoped credentials that are provisioned on demand and cleaned up automatically.

### Core principles

- Network identity first: requests must arrive over the tailnet
- Capability-based authorization: Tailscale ACL capabilities define role and validity period
- Ephemeral credentials: per-user ServiceAccounts with short-lived tokens
- Kubernetes-native RBAC: roles are bound using standard RBAC

### Components and trust

- TKA Server: terminates HTTP over tsnet, enforces identity via WhoIs, requires a specific ACL capability
- Auth Middleware: rejects Funnel traffic; extracts username and capability
- Auth Service: delegates to the operator for provisioning
- K8s Operator: creates and deletes ServiceAccounts/RoleBindings; generates tokens; never stores secrets outside the cluster

### Data flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant CLI as tka CLI
  participant TS as Tailscale (tsnet)
  participant API as TKA Server (Gin)
  participant MW as Auth Middleware (WhoIs + Capability)
  participant OP as K8s Operator
  participant K8S as Kubernetes API

  CLI->>TS: Connect to https://{hostname}.{tailnet}:{port}
  TS->>API: Forward HTTP request over tailnet
  API->>MW: Validate request
  MW->>TS: WhoIs(remoteAddr)
  TS-->>MW: Identity {loginName, capMap, isTagged}
  MW-->>API: Username + Capability (role, period)
  API->>OP: SignIn(username, role, period)
  OP->>K8S: Create SignIn CR, ServiceAccount, RoleBinding
  API-->>CLI: 202 Accepted (Retry-After)
  CLI->>API: GET /kubeconfig (poll)
  API->>OP: Kubeconfig(username)
  OP->>K8S: Generate token and build kubeconfig
  OP-->>API: kubeconfig
  API-->>CLI: 200 OK (kubeconfig)
  CLI->>API: POST /logout
  API->>OP: Logout(username)
  OP->>K8S: Delete SignIn + bindings
  API-->>CLI: 200 OK
```

### Why this design

- Leverages Tailscale for mutual auth and device/user identity; no extra ingress or OIDC setup
- Keeps Kubernetes as source of truth for authorization, using RBAC
- Uses short-lived credentials to reduce blast radius and credential sprawl
- Explicit capability name binds ACL policy to the service, avoiding accidental privilege bleed

### Threat considerations

- Funnel traffic is rejected to prevent off-tailnet access
- Tagged nodes are currently denied to avoid ambiguous identity semantics
- Capability JSON is validated; multiple rules for a user are rejected
- Tokens are generated on demand and not persisted by the server
- Logs include trace IDs; metrics are exposed separately under `/metrics/controller`

### Configuration knobs that affect security

- `tailscale.capName`: capability to require from ACLs
- `operator.namespace`: where ServiceAccounts and SignIn resources are created
- `api.retryAfterSeconds`: polling guidance only; not a security control
- Timeouts (read/write/idle): apply to HTTP server behavior
